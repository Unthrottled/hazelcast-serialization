     This is the preferred way of creating hazelcast serialization
     configuration. You should normally avoid programmatically changing
     an xml config after it has been read. To specifiy a factory,
     one would have to have been created and its fully qualifed name would
     hove to be included down below.

    <serialization>
        <portable-version>3</portable-version>
        <use-native-byte-order>true</use-native-byte-order>
        <byte-order>BIG_ENDIAN</byte-order>
        <enable-compression>false</enable-compression>
        <enable-shared-object>true</enable-shared-object>
        <allow-unsafe>false</allow-unsafe>
